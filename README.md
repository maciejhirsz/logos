_Create ridiculously fast Lexers._

**Logos** has two goals:

+ To make it easy to create a Lexer, so you can focus on more complex problems.
+ To make the generated Lexer faster than anything you'd write by hand.

To achieve those, **Logos**:

+ Combines all token definitions into a single [deterministic state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton).
+ Optimizes branches into [lookup tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table) or [jump tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_table).
+ Prevents [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS) inside token definitions.
+ [Unwinds loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling), and batches reads to minimize bounds checking.
+ Does all of that heavy lifting at compile time.

## Example

```rust
 use logos::Logos;

 #[derive(Logos, Debug, PartialEq)]
 #[logos(skip r"[ \t\n\f]+")] // Ignore this regex pattern between tokens
 enum Token {
     // Tokens can be literal strings, of any length.
     #[token("fast")]
     Fast,

     #[token(".")]
     Period,

     // Or regular expressions.
     #[regex("[a-zA-Z]+")]
     Text,
 }

 fn main() {
     let mut lex = Token::lexer("Create ridiculously fast Lexers.");

     assert_eq!(lex.next(), Some(Ok(Token::Text)));
     assert_eq!(lex.span(), 0..6);
     assert_eq!(lex.slice(), "Create");

     assert_eq!(lex.next(), Some(Ok(Token::Text)));
     assert_eq!(lex.span(), 7..19);
     assert_eq!(lex.slice(), "ridiculously");

     assert_eq!(lex.next(), Some(Ok(Token::Fast)));
     assert_eq!(lex.span(), 20..24);
     assert_eq!(lex.slice(), "fast");

     assert_eq!(lex.next(), Some(Ok(Token::Text)));
     assert_eq!(lex.slice(), "Lexers");
     assert_eq!(lex.span(), 25..31);

     assert_eq!(lex.next(), Some(Ok(Token::Period)));
     assert_eq!(lex.span(), 31..32);
     assert_eq!(lex.slice(), ".");

     assert_eq!(lex.next(), None);
 }
```

## How fast?

Ridiculously fast!

```norust

### Releasing a new version

> [!NOTE]
>
> This section is only useful for **Logos**' maintainers.

First, make sure you are logged-in https://crates.io with: `cargo login`.
If you don't have write access to **Logos**' crates, you can still
perform steps 1-4, and ask a maintainer with accesses to perform step 5.

This project uses `cargo-release` to publish all packages with more ease.
Note that, by default, every command runs in *dry mode*, and you need to append `--execute`
to actually perform the action.

Here are the following steps to release a new version:

1. create a branch `release-x.y.z` from the `master` branch;
2. run and commit `cargo release version --workspace <LEVEL>`;
3. run and commit `cargo release replace --workspace`;
4. push your branch and create a pull request;
5. and, once your branch was merged to `master`, run the following:
   ```bash
   cargo release publish --package logos-codegen
   cargo release publish --package logos-derive
   cargo release publish --package logos-cli
   cargo release publish --package logos
   ```

And voilà!
