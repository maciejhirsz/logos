# Getting Help

If you need help using **Logos**, there are three places you can go to depending
on what you are looking for:

+ [this book](intro.md) for a documented walk through **Logos**' usage, with detailed
  examples, and more. A **must read** for any newcomer;
+ [the API documentation](https://docs.rs/logos/latest/logos/) to obtain precise
  information about function signatures and what the Logos crate exposes in
  terms of features;
+ and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/maciejhirsz/logos/issues) for anything
  else that is not covered by any of the two above.

Regarding [GitHub issues](https://github.com/maciejhirsz/logos/issues),
it's highly recommended to first check if another issue, either open or closed,
already covers the topic you are looking for. If not, then consider creating a
new issue with necessary information about your question, problem or else.
