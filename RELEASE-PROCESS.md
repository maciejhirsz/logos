# Release process

First, make sure you are logged-in https://crates.io with: `cargo login`.
If you don't have write access to **Logos**' crates, you can still
perform steps 1-4, and ask a maintainer with accesses to perform step 5.

This project uses `cargo-release` to publish all packages with more ease.
Note that, by default, every command runs in *dry mode*, and you need to append `--execute`
to actually perform the action.

Here are the following steps to release a new version:

1. create a branch `release-x.y.z` from the `master` branch;
2. run and commit `cargo release version --workspace <LEVEL>`;
3. run and commit `cargo release replace --workspace`;
4. push your branch and create a pull request;
5. and, once your branch was merged to `master`, run the following:
   ```bash
   cargo release publish --package logos-codegen
   cargo release publish --package logos-derive
   cargo release publish --package logos-cli
   cargo release publish --package logos
   ```

And voil√†!
